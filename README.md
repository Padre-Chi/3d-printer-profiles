# 3d-printer-profiles

My 3D printer profiles

The PrusaSlicer directory contains a config bundle of my current profiles.
The PrusaSlicer version noted in the comment at the top of the bundle file.

I currently use a Creality Ender 3 Pro upgraded with a BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3
V1.2 mainboard, Micro Swiss Direct Drive extruder, and a BLTouch bed leveling
sensor.
